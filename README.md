# Crypto Systems Learning

## This is a portfolio of some of my crypto systems I have used to gain deeper understanding of chain technology.

## About Me:

- I am a systems and software engineer with roughly 10 years of experience programming, starting when I was 10 years old with basic robotics. 
- I am extensively knowledgable in Java, Python, JavaScript, and C/C++. I have a couple of years of experience with Rust and HTML, and am growing a solid foundation of Solidity as well. 
- I have created many projects throughout my years, a good number of physical projects that integrated software and some purely software-based projects. However, each project was almost always something I did out of passion and the desire to learn.
